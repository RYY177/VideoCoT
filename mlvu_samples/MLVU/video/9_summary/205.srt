1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Intelligent, but none is born with the skill to use a tool

2
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,649
Youngsters like this one must learn by watching

3
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:55,340
She uses special tools one after another to get all the honey she can and in a few minutes

4
00:00:55,539 --> 00:01:09,530
She destroys what took the bees years to build in the rain forest

5
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,049
Nothing is safe

6
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:25,170
Here in the Congo there can be as many as 500 trees crammed into every acre

7
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:33,040
In the battle for space some will rise to over 60 meters high in just a few decades

8
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:45,150
In a valley like this there could be close on 1,000 different species of tree

9
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:56,299
Up here the crowns barely touch each tree seems to respect its neighbors space

10
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:06,540
When they germinate down on the forest floor young trees and plants are less restrained

11
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:15,539
But every new generation fights it out in battles. We can see by accelerating time

12
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,620
They must get light if they are to survive

13
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,500
And they squeeze crush and even a slash one another in order to reach it

14
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,979
Despite the thick canopy above some sunlight does filter through and allows a few low-light

15
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:27,590
Specialists to bloom near the forest floor down here

16
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:48,400
There are animals too that seek out the sunlight the forest's largest predator a female rock python

17
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:55,550
Her body is five meters long weighs a hundred kilos and has

18
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,909
4,000 muscles that she uses to crush the life out of her victims

19
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:08,199
But right now her need is not for food. It's for warmth

20
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:19,410
she finds a rare patch where a shaft of sunlight strikes the ground and

21
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,649
She begins to bask

22
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:32,209
She's cold-blooded. So this is the only way she can raise the temperature of her body

23
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:44,930
But now she's becoming very warm indeed more than 10 degrees hotter than usual at 40 degrees centigrade

24
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,930
She's in danger of killing herself

25
00:04:51,550 --> 00:05:03,610
Just in time she moves off. He disappears below ground

26
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:19,899
This is her nest and it's full of giant eggs

27
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:29,360
It's critical for the eggs development that they stay above 30 degrees

28
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:40,670
Here in this special filming burrow. She gently wraps her superheated body around the eggs

29
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,920
Passing on to them the warmth of the Sun

30
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:54,209
She has done this every day for three months

31
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,579
the repeated heat stress on her body is so great it could be lethal and

32
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:07,750
At the very least it will take three years for her to recover from incubating this one clutch of eggs

33
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:34,850
her parchment shelled eggs carry the pressed imprint of her scales an

34
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,870
Indication of the strength of her embrace

35
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:49,370
At last her efforts are rewarded

36
00:06:49,730 --> 00:07:15,670
But the babies can't stay here. They must leave their sanctuary and find food in the tangled world above

37
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:51,009
They're over 60 centimeters long already big enough to be a threat to the smaller inhabitants of the forest

38
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:56,470
But they are themselves vulnerable
